This code works as follows:
It takes the parameter file parameters_file.dat to read the length of the simulation, the number of 
cells per axis and the path of the binary data file.

With this information, it performs a reading of the binary data file to obtain masses, 
positions (x,y,z) and velocities (vx,vy,vz) of the particles.

Then, a Cloud-In-Cell algorithm is performed in order to compute the density field of the particles. 
It is performed as follows: The simulation box is divided in the number of cells per axis powered 
to the cube. Then, each particle is localized in each cell. Once each particle is located, 
the density computation is performed in order to find the smoothed density field using the CIC 
windows function. In the same routine, the momentum computation is performed with the same window 
function as for the density computation.

Finally, a data file with index of each cell, number of particles per cell, position, momentum, 
density and density contrast is saved in the HDD.
